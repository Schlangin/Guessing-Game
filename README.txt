=============

Description
-----------
The Guessing Game is a simple, interactive Java console application that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The game features three difficulty levels—easy, medium, and hard—with each level offering a different range of numbers. Players' scores are tracked based on the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number, and a leaderboard system for each difficulty level records the top performances.

Features
--------
- **Three Difficulty Levels:** Choose between Easy (1-25), Medium (1-50), and Hard (1-100) to test your guessing skills.
- **Leaderboard System:** Each difficulty level has its own leaderboard, ranking players based on their performance.
- **Persistent Leaderboards:** Scores and rankings are saved between game sessions, allowing players to break their own records or compete with others over time.
